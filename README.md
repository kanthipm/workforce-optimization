# Workforce Optimization

This repository contains practice code and basic models developed to understand and prepare for implementing column generation and branch-and-price algorithms for technician scheduling.

**Note:** The actual proprietary code and full implementation developed during my Infosys internship are confidential and not included here.

## Purpose  
- Study and practice column generation and branch-and-price techniques.  
- Develop foundational models and utilities to support understanding of scheduling optimization algorithms.  

## Contents  
- Basic models and utilities for column generation problems.  
- Sample scripts demonstrating branch-and-price concepts.
